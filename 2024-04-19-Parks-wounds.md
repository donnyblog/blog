Open wounds by Tina Takemoto tells the ballad of two women Angela and Tina.
 Beginning with their live performances together which aimed to address the representation of women in relation to body and race.
 This was done with their augmentation of their bodies like stuffing fishnet stockings with marshmallows or prodigy their dress with hundreds of sharpened wooden chopsticks in an attempt to bring forth the question of “overdetermined visibility”
  This was while Angela was fighting with Hodgkin’s disease, a form of cancer.
  So, these performances became a way for the two to cope and respond to her worsing state.
  Later the pair began work on another project this time centered around photography; the series of photographs followed the theme of thinking through the skin.
  It also focused on descriptions of Angela’s illness, followed her symptoms to photograph for equivalents to her physical state, something that Tina stated she  was transfixed on. 

I really enjoyed how supportive Tina was with Angela especially when they cut their hair together and how dedicated she was to try and experience what her friend was going through. 
 How creative the two are with their projects I felt as if the ideas for their photos are unique and totally abstract even when they cut their hair by putting in gum and shearing it out. 

This chapter is stuffed full of themes of managing sickness and stressing the value of sincere support despite the impossibility of fully capturing the depth of another person's feelings.
Tina becomes very vulnerable telling this story and that is something I really appreciate. 

The way that Tina Takemote weaves the saga of her friend and with topics of race and sexuality is very interesting and it makes the reader really experience a different perspective.
